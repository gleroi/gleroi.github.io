== About

I am Guillaume, a developer in Lyon (France). I am currently working for
http://www.keyconsulting.fr[Key Consulting].

My professional interests are solving problems by working closely with our users, analysing the various solutions, evaluating the technical needs and merits of a solution and finally implementing it. And then do it again !

I have worked in various domains, especially for energy companies (Engie, Enedis), quality management company (Trigo) and some public institutions (French ministry of Ecology, Agency of Ile de France parkland).

I have some expertises in .NET frameworks (WPF, ASP.NET MVC), and more recently Go.
